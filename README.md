# pneumoScope

pneumoScope is a personal machine learning project designed to detect pneumonia from chest cavity imaging, such as X-rays and CT scans. This repository contains the code and resources to perform a three-step process:

**1) Data Extraction and Exploration:** We provide tools and scripts to extract, preprocess, and explore the dataset. Understanding the data is crucial for building effective pneumonia detection models.

**2) Classifier and Neural Network Models:** PneumoDetect utilizes a variety of classifiers, neural network architectures, and transfer learning models to achieve high accuracy in pneumonia detection. We offer a selection of pre-trained models and tools for training custom models.

**3) Data Augmentation:** Augmenting the dataset is essential for training robust models. PneumoDetect includes data augmentation techniques and utilities to enhance model performance.

## Disclaimer: Project was done through Google Colab notebooks, so there are errors specific to the environment.
